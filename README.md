# BabelBuilder
Babel builder is a tower building game where a user must time their placement of flying tower segments to ensure that their tower grows as tall as possible. If the playerâ€™s segment timing is off an overhang occurs and that part of the segment  crumbles making it progressively harder as the game progresses!
